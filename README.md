Data.SSTV
=========

A library for generating Slow Scan TV modulation from Haskell.

This is horrible right now and you probably shouldn't use it.

Also, a big thank you to András Veres-Szentkirályi (@dnet) for his
[https://github.com/dnet/pySSTV/](pySSTV) project, from which a lot of the
concepts in this codebase are derived.
